Integrating Socket.IO (input/output)
Socket.IO is composed of two parts:

-A server that integrates with (or mounts on) the Node.JS HTTP Server socket.io
-A client library that loads on the browser side socket.io-client

During development, socket.io serves the client automatically for us, as weâ€™ll see, so for now we only have to install one module


The main idea behind Socket.IO is that you can send and receive any events you want, with any data you want. Any objects that can be encoded as JSON will do, and binary data is supported too.

In order to send an event to everyone, Socket.IO gives us the io.emit() method.
io.emit('some event', { someProperty: 'some value', otherProperty: 'other value' }); // This will emit the event to all connected sockets
